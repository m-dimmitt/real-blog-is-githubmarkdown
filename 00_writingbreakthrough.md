Made a breakthrough in my (non-programming) writing today.
been wondering for some time why my new program ideas come easily and toward purpose. even programs that are alternative solutions to problems currently solved feel program purposeful. but my creative writing finds stagnation. In generation of new ideas.
Ive known for a while my creative writing has had an organization problem.
I feel ive figured it out;

```
At first
I was plaguedÂ 
now I think I might be two steps closer
*Step2:* quick retrieval by having
a defined well to drink/(refer-back) from,
(I have been doing this with blogs and blogtypes)

the plague; how to organize, hard to organize
*Step1:* solution, better many different organization forms and redundant data than organization and one place.

note: and one thing I struggled with, just because data is redundant does not mean those data points need to be connected;
pointers the redundant data's organization info-hub.
