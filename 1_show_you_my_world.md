<pre>
let me show you my world,
to start with. a year in the life,

start down a path.

path leads becoming many things.
become a programmer... eventually learn programmer types.

intermittently be one or the another programmer type. and being you.

write down self types so that, consciously aware; able to use different hats.


scale it to being more than programming.
many types of many genre.

realize comfort.
this is what it means for you to naturally be myself.
it is not like I sought, or this my best self.
years or year led to this and Im simply not trying
but have many interests.
And have learned these paths. And this deals with boredom and gives purpose.

I realize some do not move down this path.
some never scratch the itch
some shoot to be only one type of programmer.
not many types of programmer.
some choose to be only one type of one genre.
  and thats fine.


Second,

Facebook... led me down this path.
ultimately my timeline got boring. really boring.
because its not so much my profile.

its more the newsfeed of people presented through my network
adding no new information.
I already know these people.

i down want to veiw my timeline as other people.
I want to view others timelines and
continually acquire new information, not to be bored.
